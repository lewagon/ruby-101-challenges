## Specs

- Implement a ruby method that returns an `Array` of the playlist with your new favorite song inside!
- The method should take an `Array` of your current playlist and add your new favorite song as a `String` in parameters.

`add_song_to_playlist(["Hotel California", "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Stairway To Heaven"], "Despacito")` should return:

`["Hotel California", "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Stairway To Heaven", "Despacito"]`

## Key Learning Points

- `Array` CRUD
- `return` statement in methods
