## Background

Fizz buzz is a group word game. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "Fizz", any number divisible by five with the word "Buzz", and any number divisible by five and three by "FizzBuzz". Started out as a game for children to learn about divisions, it has now also become a drinking game for math enthusiasts.

## Specs

- Implement a Ruby method `fizzbuzz` that builds a list of fizzbuzz elements
- This method should take one argument (max), a `Integer`, and return an `Array` containing `Integers` and `Strings` where appropriate (see examples)
- You can assume the single argument is an `Integer`

`fizzbuzz(6)` should return `[1, 2, 'Fizz', 4, 'Buzz', 'Fizz']`

`fizzbuzz(16)` should return `[1, 2, 'Fizz', 4, 'Buzz', 'Fizz', 7, 8, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 11, 'Fizz', 13, 14, 'FizzBuzz', 16]`

`fizzbuzz(0)` should return `[]`

## Key Learning Points

- `String` methods
- `return` statement in methods
- Loops and Conditionals
- Returning an `Array`
